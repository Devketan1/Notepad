Java project for building Notepad.

It's basically the same version of notepad that Windows provides us. But unlike that one whose coding take place in C# and C Sharp, I have
make use of Java. Just used the basic concepts of Java Swings, Java awt .
The Interface for choosing Background color and Foreground color have been enhanced a bit. Rest of the functionalities remains the same.
